# GeneRegLocator
Streamline the assignment of ATAC peaks to cis-regulatory regions, facilitating valuable links between these regions and genes.

## Installation
This repository contains powerful Python functions designed to work with Python 3 (tested with Python 3.9). To utilize these functions, ensure you have the pybedtools library installed. For installation options, please refer to the official documentation at http://daler.github.io/pybedtools/main.html.

Stay tuned for the forthcoming conda environment, which will further simplify the setup process.

## Define Regulatory Zones
A powerful Python program to define cis-regulatory zones from various feature coordinates, commonly bed files containing transcription start site coordinates. Effortlessly extend coordinates to define regulatory zones, customizing the extension length as needed for your experiments. Optional filtering based on additional coordinates enhances precision and focuses on specific genomic regions of interest, streamlining downstream analyses. Simplify regulatory zone definition and gain deeper insights into gene regulation with this versatile tool.
